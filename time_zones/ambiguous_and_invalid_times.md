# Ambiguous times
Refers to a time in a time zone that can be mapped to two different instances in time. If a time zone is transitioning from daylight saving time to standard time at 2:00 AM and reverts clock time to 1:00 AM, there will be two times that day when the time was between 1:00 AM and 2:00 AM: once prior to reverting clock time and once following reversion.

# Invalid time
Refers to a time that could not have existed in a time zone. For instance, if a time zone is returning to daylight saving time and changes clock time from 2:00 AM to 3:00 AM, there will have been no time during that day when the time was between 2:00 AM and 3:00 AM.
